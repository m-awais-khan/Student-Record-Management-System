# Student Record Management System

## Description

This C++ program implements a basic Student Record Management System. It allows users to manage student records by performing various operations such as adding records, deleting records, and sorting records based on different criteria. This is my 1st semester project of BSCS.

The program uses arrays to store student information, including roll number, midterm marks, final exam marks, class, and grade. Users can interact with the system through a menu-driven interface and choose from different options such as adding records, deleting records, and sorting records based on different parameters like marks and grades.

## Features
- Add Record : Allows users to add student records by entering roll number, midterm marks, final exam marks, class, and grade.
- Delete Record : Enables users to delete a student record based on the roll number.
- Sort Records : Provides options to sort records based on midterm marks, final exam marks, and grades. The records can be sorted in both ascending and descending orders.
- View Records : Allows users to view the student records in a tabular format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the Student Record Management System.

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Student Record

1. Select the option to add a new student record from the `menu`.
2. Enter the student's roll number, midterm marks, final marks, class, and grade when prompted.
3. The record will be added to the system.

### Deleting a Student Record

1. Choose the option to delete a student record by roll number.
2. Enter the roll number of the student whose record you want to delete.
3. The record will be removed from the system.

### Sorting Records by Final Marks

1. Select the sorting option based on final marks in ascending or descending order.
2. The records will be displayed according to the selected sorting order.

## Notes
